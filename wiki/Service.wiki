==In-App Version Checking==

When a new app version is released, developers often want to notify existing users that an update is available. However, there's no market API to query the version and update information for Android. 

A simple solution is to setup a web service for an app, and update the content when an app is uploaded to the market place.

==AQuery Market API==

AQuery offers a simple web service for any Android app to check against their version info and prompt the user with recent changes and allow user to update if they prefer. The service is free and is packaged with the core AQuery lib.

===Code===

Invoking a service is simple. Add these 3 lines in your launching activity.

{{{

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
	
	super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
	
	if(isTaskRoot()){			
		MarketService ms = new MarketService(this);
		ms.level(MarketService.MINOR).checkVersion();
	}
	
}
}}}
