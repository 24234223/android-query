#summary Error handling and reporting with AQuery.

= Error Handling =

AQuery handled the errors that will cause an application to exit.


== Debuging ==

Debug logging can be turned on:

{{{
AQUtility.setDebug(true);
}}}

AQuery will log all the exceptions and important events such as an http request.

Make sure debugging is not on in your production app.
