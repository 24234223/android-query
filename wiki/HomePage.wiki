=Android Query=

Android-Query (AQuery)is a light-weight library for manipulating UI elements in Android. The goal is to make UI coding simpler and easier.

==Why AQuery? ==


===Less Code===

===Chaining===

===Bypass API Limitation===

Fragmentation is annoying for Android. Features in new API are great, but majority of mobile devices are not updated with the latest API.

AQuery alleviate this issue by dynamically inspecting the Android framework, and make new API features available to code that are compiled for lower API.

Enable hardware acceleration with pre-11 API:
{{{
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){
  	
  	//My API level 4 onCreate setup here... 
  	
	AQuery aq = new AQuery(this);	
	
	//Enable hardware acceleration if the device has API 11 or above	
	aq.hardwareAccelerated();
	
}

}}}


===Extend-able===

===Light Weight===

Memory is scarce for mobile apps. The AQuery lib is standalone and relatively small (~10k for 0.0.1).

=Contribute!=

AQuery is a new library and need nourishment from the community. The initial version is only covering a small (but frequently used) of the Android UI framework.
